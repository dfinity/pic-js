Pic JS is a library for interacting with a local instance of `pocket-ic` from TypeScript.

The `pocket-ic` is a canister testing platform for the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). It is a standalone executable that can be used to test canisters locally, without the need to deploy them to a full replica.

Other languages available include [Python](https://github.com/dfinity/pocketic-py/) and [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/packages/pocket-ic).
