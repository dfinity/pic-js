# Todo

This example demonstrates how to work with more complex canisters, identities, canister upgrades, and stable memory management. It also shows how to use "live" mode with agent-js (in contrast to the pic-js actor).

Build the counter canister:

```shell
bun build:todo
```

Run the counter tests:

```shell
bun test:todo
```
